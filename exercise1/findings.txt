Docker containers share certain resources with the host while maintaining isolation.

Kernel: Containers use the host’s kernel, allowing system-level operations without the overhead of a full virtual machine.

File System: By default, containers have isolated file systems, but volumes and bind mounts allow file sharing with the host for data persistence.

Networking: Containers can access the host’s network through port forwarding (bridge mode). In host mode, containers share the host’s network stack.

Process Management: While container processes run in isolated namespaces, they are visible from the host’s process list, allowing monitoring.

Resource Limits: Containers share the host’s CPU, memory, and I/O, but Docker allows resource limits via control groups (cgroups) to prevent resource overuse.

In summary, containers share the host's kernel, network, and resources, but remain isolated in terms of file systems and processes for security.
